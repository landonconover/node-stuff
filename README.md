1. Fork this repository
1. Clone your fork onto your computer
1. Create a `package.json` file using `npm init`
1. Create a `bower.json` file using `bower init`
1. Install at least one bower component to be used in your project (angular
  would be a good one)
1. Using either `grunt` or `gulp`, create a set of tasks that can build your
  source files into 1 `.js` file and 1 `.css` file. You may use preprocessors

  necessary to `public/index.html` in order to make your app work.
1. When completed, submit a pull request from your fork to this one from
  [here](https://github.com/ksmithut/node-stuff/pulls).
